# Blackjack-Python
Blackjack game created in Python

Thanks for checking out my Blackjack game.  This was my final project that I had to do for an Introduction to Python course that I took.

First of all, I would like to give a HUGE shout-out and give thanks to my tutor, and my teacher Dean McLaughlin.  If it wasn't for his patience with me, and his excellent ability to explain how everything works, this project would only have a menu, lol.

Prior to this, I had very little experience with Python.  This was an excellent learning exercise to see how something that is relatively simple can be a lot more difficult than one thinks. I decided to build the program to work with importing modules, rather than just a bunch on  if statements, and simple functions.  I felt that this way seemed like I would be able to discover the bugs as they popped up, and when the final program was complete, there would be very few bugs to work out.

Thanks to a website that I can't remember for the free ASCII Art for the Welcome to Blackjack sign.  I'd give better credit, but, I forgot then...
to who you are... thanks, and be happy I at least remembered, lol

As I continue to work on this program, I have discovered so many little features that could be added later down the road, and thought about other ways to save, and recall information.  Some of which I will do in later versions of the game.  I look forward to seeing this game evolve from just a simple Blackjack game.
